"""Graph node implementations split by responsibility.

This package exports all agent node factories organized by role:

- ``RuntimeContext``: Immutable dependency container passed to all factories.
- ``architect_supervisor`` / ``validator_supervisor``: Orchestration agents that
  decompose tasks into domain-specific assignments.
- ``compute_architect``, ``network_architect``, etc.: Domain-specific architect
  agents that generate infrastructure recommendations.
- ``compute_validator``, ``network_validator``, etc.: Domain-specific validator
  agents that check recommendations against documentation.
- ``architect_synthesizer``, ``validation_synthesizer``: Fan-in agents that
  merge parallel domain outputs.
- ``final_architecture_generator``: Terminal node that produces the final document.
