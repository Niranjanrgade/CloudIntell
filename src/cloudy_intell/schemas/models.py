"""Pydantic and state schemas used by graph nodes.

These models were extracted from the notebook-style implementation and kept
intentionally close to existing behavior to reduce migration risk.

This module defines two categories of contracts:

1. **Pydantic Models** (DomainTask, TaskDecomposition, ValidationTask,
   ValidationDecomposition) — These are used with ``with_structured_output()``
   so the LLM returns validated, typed JSON that supervisors and domain agents
   can consume without ad-hoc parsing.

2. **LangGraph State TypedDict** — A single ``State`` class annotated with
   custom reducer functions.  LangGraph merges partial dicts returned by each
   node into the shared state using these reducers, enabling fan-out/fan-in
   parallelism and iterative refinement without manual bookkeeping.

Reducer functions (``merge_dicts``, ``last_value``, ``or_reducer``, etc.) are
defined here rather than in a utility module so that the State class and its
semantics live in one self-contained file.
