"""Synthesis node factories for architecture and validation stages.

All prompt text is driven by ``RuntimeContext.provider`` metadata, making
these factories provider-agnostic (AWS, Azure, GCP, etc.).

Synthesizers are fan-in nodes that collect outputs from parallel domain agents
and merge them into coherent summaries:

- **Architect Synthesizer**: Merges the four domain architects' recommendations
  into a single unified architecture proposal.
- **Validation Synthesizer**: Consolidates the four domain validators' feedback
  into an actionable validation summary with priority fixes.
- **Final Architecture Generator**: Produces the polished, production-ready
  architecture document after all iterations converge.

All synthesizers use the reasoning LLM (higher capability) because they need
to understand and integrate content across multiple domains coherently.
