"""Supervisor node factories.

All prompt text is driven by ``RuntimeContext.provider`` metadata, making
these factories provider-agnostic (AWS, Azure, GCP, etc.).

Supervisors are the "orchestration" agents in the workflow:

- **Architect Supervisor**: Receives the user problem and decomposes it into
  structured, domain-specific task assignments (one per domain).  On subsequent
  iterations, it incorporates validation feedback to produce refined tasks.
  Uses ``with_structured_output(TaskDecomposition)`` to guarantee the LLM
  returns valid, typed JSON matching the Pydantic schema.

- **Validator Supervisor**: Inspects the proposed architecture components and
  creates targeted validation assignments for each domain that has active
  components.  Uses ``with_structured_output(ValidationDecomposition)``.

Both supervisors include retry logic with exponential backoff to handle
transient LLM API failures gracefully.
