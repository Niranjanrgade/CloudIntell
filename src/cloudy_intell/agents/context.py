"""Runtime context passed to node factories.

This keeps module functions pure-ish and prevents hidden global coupling.
Every graph node factory receives a ``RuntimeContext`` instance and closes
over it, so all dependencies (LLMs, tools, settings, provider metadata) are
explicit rather than imported from global singletons.

The frozen dataclass ensures the context is immutable after construction,
which is critical because multiple domain nodes read it concurrently during
parallel fan-out execution.
