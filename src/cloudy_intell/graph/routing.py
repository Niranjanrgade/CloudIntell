"""Routing helpers for graph iteration decisions.

This module contains the conditional routing function used by the top-level
graph to decide whether to loop back for another architect→validate iteration
or proceed to final output generation.

The routing logic implements an Evaluator-Optimizer pattern:
- Run at least ``min_iterations`` regardless of validation outcome.
- Continue iterating if ``factual_errors_exist`` is True and iteration count
  is below ``max_iterations``.
- Finish immediately once ``max_iterations`` is reached.
"""


def iteration_condition(state: dict) -> str:
    """Decide whether graph should iterate again or finish.

    The function mirrors runtime logic used in synthesizer module while keeping
    this module dependency-light for testing and reuse.

    Decision logic:
    - If iteration_count < min_iterations: always iterate (force minimum passes).
    - If factual_errors_exist and iteration_count < max_iterations: iterate to fix.
    - If iteration_count >= max_iterations: always finish (hard stop).
    - Otherwise: finish (no errors found, minimum met).

    Args:
        state: Current graph state dict.

    Returns:
        "iterate" to loop back to architect_phase, or "finish" to proceed
        to final_architecture_generator.
