"""State initialization helpers.

Reducer functions live in ``schemas.models`` to keep one source of truth for
LangGraph annotations; this module provides initialization helpers and shared
state constants used by graph/service code.

The ``create_initial_state`` function returns a fully populated State dict with
sensible defaults for every tracked field.  This is critical because LangGraph
expects all annotated keys to be present in the initial state—omitting a key
would cause a KeyError when reducer functions try to merge partial updates.

                      the user (e.g. "Design a secure, scalable three-tier web app").
