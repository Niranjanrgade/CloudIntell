"""Checkpointer factory wrappers.

Checkpointers enable LangGraph to persist state between node executions,
making the workflow resumable and observable.  The ``MemorySaver`` stores
state in memory (suitable for development and single-process runs).  This
factory method exists as an extensibility seam for swapping in a persistent
backend (e.g. SQLite, PostgreSQL) without changing the graph builder code.
