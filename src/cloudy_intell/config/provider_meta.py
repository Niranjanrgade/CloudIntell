"""Cloud provider metadata definitions.

Each provider carries its own domain-service mappings, prompt role labels,
validation checklists, and vector-store keys so that agent modules can render
provider-specific behaviour without hardcoding cloud vendor names.

This module is the single source of truth for everything that differs between
cloud providers.  Adding a new provider (e.g. GCP) requires only defining a
new ``ProviderMeta`` instance and registering it in ``PROVIDER_REGISTRY``;
no agent or graph code needs to change.

The frozen dataclass ensures metadata is immutable once created, preventing
accidental mutation during parallel node execution.
